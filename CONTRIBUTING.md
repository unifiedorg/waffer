# Contributing to Unified
If you are reading this, you (probably) want to contribute! We love user/developer input to help make our projects better. As we want to make contributing to us as easy as possible, here is a small list of what you can do:

- Report bugs
- Discussing code
- Submit fixes
- Proposing new features
- Adding new features (if you have the time for it!)
- Become a maintainer of an abandoned project

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code follows the best practices.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## Issues
### Creating a new issue
If you run into an issue, you can search if that issue has been reported before. If not, you can create an issue, using the relevant tags, form, etc.

### Solving an issue
As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.[1](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#solve-an-issue)

### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or things you tried that didn't work)

Here is a **template** which you *should* follow:
```
## Description :
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

## Steps to reproduce :
 - Steps

## Expected results :
 What that *should* have happened.

## Actual results :
What that *actually* have happened.

## Notes :
Any additional information you want to add.

## Screenshot/Video (optional) : 

## Device and Device info : 
- Device : [e.g. Desktop, Laptop, iPhone12]
- OS : [e.g. Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android]
- Browser : [e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari] (if applicable)
```

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
- 2 spaces indentation rather than tab.
